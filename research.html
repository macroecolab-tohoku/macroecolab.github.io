    <b>Advancements for species distribution modeling</b>. Species distribution models (SDMs) make estimates of habitat suitability, range limits, and niche relationships with environmental variables. For example, we use SDMs to map biodiversity patterns at large geographic scales (A: [Kass et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abp9908)); employ SDMs for various applications including climate change impacts, conservation, and invasion risk (B: image from Kass et al. *in review*); and work with collaborators to develop open-source tools for community use such as the R package [ENMeval](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13628) (C), which enables automated tuning of complexity for SDMs, and the R application [Wallace EcoMod](https://doi.org/10.1111/ecog.06547) (D), which allows users to complete a reproducible SDM workflow using an interactive graphic-user interface.
